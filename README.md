Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey?
Seeing as how the top two starting locations are also the top ending locations, it may be because this is likely the location where people started riding and it made logical sense to them to return it to the same place. It would also help the argument that these are large tourist areas and also plenty of foot/vehicle traffic.
